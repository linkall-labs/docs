# Source
source connector obtains data from an underlying data producer and delivers it to targets, after original data has been transformed into CloudEvents. Vanus doesn't limit the way how a source retrieves data. (e.g., A source may pull data from a message queue or act as an HTTP server waiting for data sent to it).
