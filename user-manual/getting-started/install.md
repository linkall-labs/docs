# Installation
Vanus design is based on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), and the installation relies on its environment.

In this section, the two pages introduce two different methods of installing Vanus into a Kubernetes environment.

Below, you can find two links to install Vanus into a Kubernetes environment.

- [Minikube](install/minikube.md): For local environment, we recommend you use minikube to run Vanus.
- [Kubernetes](install/k8s(recommended).md): For testing or production environment, we recommend you use a stable kubernetes cluster to run Vanus.
