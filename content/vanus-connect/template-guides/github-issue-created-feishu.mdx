# GitHub issue event triggers a Feishu message

GitHub is the largest web-based platform that provides developers with a place to host and manage their software projects.

You can receive notifications when specific events occur in a repository by adding a GitHub Source on Vanus Cloud.

This guide will help you get a FeiShu notification whenever an issue is opened in your repository.
