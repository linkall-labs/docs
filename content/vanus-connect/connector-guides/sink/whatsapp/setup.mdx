# WhatsApp

This guide contains information to set up a WhatsApp Sink in Vanus Connect.

## Introduction

WhatsApp is a widely-used messaging application that allows users to send messages, make calls, share files, and participate in group chats. It offers a user-friendly interface, cross-platform compatibility, and features like end-to-end encryption. With its popularity and regular updates, WhatsApp has become a primary communication tool for individuals, families, friends, and businesses worldwide.

The WhatsApp sink connector facilitates the reception of events from external sources to your WhatsApp account. It further enables the integration of ChatGPT with WhatsApp, enabling seamless communication with ChatGPT directly from your WhatsApp account.
