# Auth0

This guide contains information to set up a Auth0 Source in Vanus Connect.

## Introduction

Auth0 is an authentication and authorization platform that provides security solutions for applications, websites, and APIs. It offers features such as single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, and social logins, among others.
