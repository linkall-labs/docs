## Using *Personal Usage of ChatGPT within WhatsApp* Template

To use ChatGPT on WhatsApp for personal use:

- On WhatsApp, Click on the Contact button, a list of all your contacts will be displayed. Select the one with your contact profile. This way, you chat with ChatGPT by chatting with yourself.
