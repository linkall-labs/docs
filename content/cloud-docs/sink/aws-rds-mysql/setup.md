# Prerequisites

Before forwarding events to MySQL, you must have:

- A Mysql server 

# Getting Started 

Perform the following steps to configure your Amazon RDS MySQL Sink:

## Step 1: Setup A Mysql server in AWS using RDS

### Create an RDS account  
1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) using your root account credentials.

2. Type "RDS" in the search box and select it from the results.

3. In the top right corner of the Amazon RDS console, select the Region in which you want to create the DB instance.

4. Click on **Create database** in the **Create Database** section.

2. Leave the default value for edition, and select the **Free Tier Template** for testing or **Production Template** for production.

>**Note** 
Multi-AZ deployment is not available for the free tier, you will have to pay for it. Using a Multi-AZ deployment automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone.

#### Settings

- **DB Instance Identifier:** Type a name unique to the region your DB instance has been set in.  

- **Master Username:** This is the username that would be used to log in to your DB instance.  

- **Master Password:** Type a password that takes the given constraints into consideration.  

- **Confirm password:** Type the password again.  


#### Instance configuration and storage   
1. Leave the default Instance configuration. 

2. Select the gp2 storage type, it's efficient and cost effective for our intended use.

#### Connectivity   
1. Leave the default subnet group.  

2. Enable public access, this allocates an IP to your database instance and allows direct connection to the database from your own device.

3. Select **Create new VPC security group**. This would create a security group that allows connection from the IP address of the device that you are currently using, to the database you created.  

4. Leave **Database port** on 3306

5. Select the password method of authentication.   

6. Leave **enabled monitoring** unchecked, to stay within the free tier limit.

7. Set a database name. If you do not provide one, Amazon RDS will not create a database on your instance being created.  

8. Set your preferred backup retention period.

9. Leave **Deletion protection** unchecked, checking the box prevents you from being able to delete the database.

10. Click on **create database**  
![18](images/15.png)   

11. Your DB is now being created. This could take a few minutes.

5. Change the type to 'All traffic', Source 'Anywhere-IPv4' and click **Save rules**

Now you can connect to your server and create a table and database. 

## Step 2: Setup your connection in Vanus Cloud
**To set up rds-mysql Sink in Vanus Cloud:**

1. Click on the server you just created in AWS RDS.
![](images/23.png)
2. Now copy and paste your **Endpoint** and **Port** into vanus.
![](images/24.png)
- **Host:** This is your RDS endpoint.
- **Port:** Enter the port number on which your MySQL server is listening. The default port for MySQL is 3306.
3. Enter the rest of your credentials
- **Username:** Master username selected during the database creation.
- **Password:** User password.
- **Database Name:** The initial database name.
- **Table Name:** The name of the table you want your events to be sent to.
- Chose the insertion mode.
4. Click `Next` and finish the configurations.

# Custom Connection

The event data must be in JSON format and created following the structure of your database, here's an example:

```json
{
  "title": "value",
  "date": "value",
  "ect...": "value"
}
```
