# ChatGPT

This guide contains information to set up a ChatGPT Source in Vanus Cloud.

## Introduction

ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture.

ChatGPT Source is a Vanus-hosted ChatGPT service which works as an HTTP server to generate human-like responses to textual content from incoming HTTP requests,
and deliver responses to endpoints in the CloudEvents HTTP format.

## Prerequisites

Before obtaining ChatGPT events, you must have:

- A [Vanus Cloud account](https://cloud.vanus.ai)

## Getting Started

1. Log in to your [Vanus Dashboard](https://cloud.vanus.ai/dashboard).
2. Click on the **create connection** button under connections.
3. From the list of sources, choose **ChatGPT**.
4. Click **`Next`** to save the ChatGPT Source.

## Supported Events

The ChatGPT requires a text/plain payload from the incoming HTTP request.

### HTTP request sample

Use `curl` to send an HTTP request to ChatGPT Source

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://hu7xxxxxxxxx.connector.vanustest.com' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw 'what is vanus'
```
