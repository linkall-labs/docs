# Snowflake

This guide contains information to set up a Snowflake Sink in Vanus Cloud.

## Introduction

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that enables businesses to store, analyze, and share large amounts of structured and semi-structured data. With the Streams menu and Snowflake Sink connector in Vanus Cloud, you can easily forward real-time updates to a designated table in your Snowflake account, allowing you to track events generated by your application.

## Prerequisites

- A [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) account with administrative privileges
- A [Vanus Cloud](https://cloud.vanus.ai) account
- A Snowflake table to which you want to send the events

You will also need the following information from your Snowflake account:

- Account URL
- Role
- Warehouse
- Database
- Schema
- Username
- Password
