#  Vanus Connect vs Open Source

Vanus is an open-source product available in two versions: the [cloud solution](https://cloud.vanus.ai) and the self-hosted release. While both versions offer bug fixes and new features, they differ in their release schedules and management processes.

The [cloud version](https://cloud.vanus.ai) receives frequent updates, with bug fixes and new features rolled out multiple times per week. This version undergoes rigorous testing in the cloud environment, allowing for prompt bug resolution. It provides a hassle-free experience as our team handles all the hosting and management aspects.

On the other hand, the self-hosted release follows a longer-term support model. It combines all the changes made in the cloud version every few months into a comprehensive update. With the self-hosted version, you gain control over the installation, hosting, and management of the product on your own infrastructure.

Here's the overview of all the differences:

We manage everything, so you don't have to worry about anything and can focus on your business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | You do it all yourself. You need to get a server, and you need to manage your infrastructure. You are responsible for installation, maintenance, upgrades, server capacity, uptime, backup, security, stability, consistency, loading time and so on.                                                                                                    |
| **Release**         | Continuously developed and improved with new features and updates multiple times per week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | It's a long-term release published so the latest features won't be immediately available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **User Interface**  | Vanus Connect offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies the creation of event pipelines. With its intuitive design, users can easily set up and manage their pipelines without complexity. Additionally, the platform provides a variety of pre-configured templates for common real-life scenarios. These templates eliminate the need for manual subscription creation, making it even more convenient for users to get started with their event-processing workflows. | The Vanus OSS version does not include a graphical user interface. To utilize Vanus OSS, users must rely on the command-line interface (CLI) for configuration and management. Additionally, creating event pipelines in Vanus OSS requires using VS Control, a dedicated tool that facilitates the setup and management in the self-hosted environment. |
| **Premium Support** | 24-hour support delivered by the Vanus team, who build and maintain Vanus and community support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Self-hosting with Vanus includes community support and limited assistance from the Vanus team. However, the level of support may not be as extensive as in Vanus Connect.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Costs**           | Vanus Connect will offer both a free and monthly subscription plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | You need to pay for your server, backups and other costs associated with running the infrastructure. You never have to pay any fees to us. Your money goes to 3rd party companies with no connection to us.                                                                                                                                              |
