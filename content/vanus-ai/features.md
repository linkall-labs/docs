# Vanus AI Features

This flexibility allows you to enrich the training process and enhance the overall capabilities of your AI system. It enables accurate answers, contextual responses, visual information processing, and access to reputable online sources. With diverse file types, your AI system becomes comprehensive, delivering intelligent recommendations, personalized assistance, and high-quality content. 

## Prompt

The prompt feature is a critical component that guides the application on how to respond when faced with an unfamiliar question. By saving a prompt as a draft under a specific title, the system associates it with relevant information. When a user poses a question containing that title, and the answer is not available in the knowledge base, the application references the prompt drafts to find a matching title. It then retrieves and presents the prompt saved within that specific draft to the user, ensuring a response is provided even in cases where the system lacks explicit knowledge on the subject.
