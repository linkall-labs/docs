# What is Vanus AI
Vanus AI is a component of Vanus Cloud, that allows users and enterprises to leverage its platform in building AI Applications based on Large Language Models. These AI applications can be built in minutes without writing any code. It provides a knowledge base feature that makes training the AI application simple. Training your AI application is as easy as uploading website URLs, PDFs, images and other file types with relevant content. Vanus AI can be used to build applications for different business fields and purposes such as intelligent customer service applications, an investment research assistant, a translator, and a health Q&A bot, among other things. The possibilities are endless. 
The created AI Applications can interact with many existing apps, databases and search engines, through the Vanus plugin mechanism. In addition, you can also integrate 3rd party apps with your created application through the vanus connects' integration ability. For example, your created AI application can be connected to a WhatsApp business account or MySQL database to enable real-time data streaming between the AI application's knowledge base and the 3rd party application. The application continuously receives data from the connected services and updates its knowledge base, keeping it up-to-date and efficient.
