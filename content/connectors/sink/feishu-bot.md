# Feishu-bot Sink
This document provides a brief introduction to the MySQL Sink.
It is also designed to guide you through the process of running a
MySQL Sink Connector.

## Introduction

The Feishu-bot Sink is a [Vance Connector][vc] which aims to handle incoming CloudEvents in a way that extracts the `data` part of the
original event and deliver these extracted `data` to the webhook URL of a Feishu custom robot.

For example, if the incoming CloudEvent looks like:

```http
{
  "id" : "42d5b039-daef-4071-8584-e61df8fc1354",
  "source" : "vance-http-source",
  "specversion" : "V1",
  "type" : "http",
  "datacontenttype" : "application/json",
  "time" : "2022-05-17T18:44:02.681+08:00",
  "data" : {
    "myData" : "simulation event data <1>"
  }
}
```

The Feishu-bot Sink will POST an HTTP request to the Feishu bot which looks like:

``` json
> POST /payload HTTP/2

> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: VanceCDK-HttpClient/1.0.0
> Content-Type: application/json
> Content-Length: 102

> {
>   "timestamp": "1599360473",
>   "sign": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
>   "msg_type": "text",
>   "content": {
>      "text": "simulation event data <1>"
>   }
> }
```

## Feishu-bot Sink Configs

Users can specify their configs by either setting environments variables or mount a config.json to
`/vance/config/config.json` when they run the connector. Find examples of setting configs [here][config].

### Config Fields of the Feishu-bot Sink

| Configs   | Description                                                            | Example                 |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------|
| v_target  | v_target is used to specify the target URL HTTP Sink will send data to. In this case, the target should be the webhook URL of the Feishu bot.| "https://open.feishu.cn/open-apis/bot/v2/hook/......" |
| v_port    | v_port is used to specify the port HTTP Sink is listening on           | "8080"                  |
| feishu_secret  | feishu_secret is used to specify the signature used to verify whether http requests are valid.         | "****************"                  |

## Add a Custom Bot to Your Feishu Group

Go to your target group, click Chat Settings > Group Bots > Add Bot, and select Custom Bot to add the bot to the group chat.

Enter a name and description for your bot, or set up an avatar for the bot, and then click "Add".

You will get the webhook address of the bot in the following format:

```
https://open.feishu.cn/open-apis/bot/v2/hook/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The webhook URL should be used as the field of `v_target` for Feishu-bot configs.

> ⚠️ Please keep this webhook address properly. Do not publish it on GitHub, blogs, and other publicly accessible sites to avoid it being maliciously called to send spam messages.

>  ⚠️ You must set your signature verification to use this connector.

The signature should be used as the field of `feishu_secret` for Feishu-bot configs.
