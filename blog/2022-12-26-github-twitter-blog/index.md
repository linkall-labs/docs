# How to Receive GitHub notifications on Twitter

As a GitHub and OSS enthusiast, have you ever experienced missing some of your important GitHub emails because tons of unread emails waiting in your mailbox . Or you wanna receive a custom notification when someone stars your repo but GitHub can never send such notifications to you.

Now, problem solved! You can receive custom event notifications directly in your Twitter account without checking your email by using a **Serverless Message Queue — Vanus**.

To achieve that we need one program to receive GitHub events and transform them into custom notifications we want and another Program to receive transformed notifications and send them to our Twitter account.

Luckily, Vanus has already provided many **out-of-the-box Connectors** that enable you to integrate with popular services or applications without writing any codes.

**Here is how we can do this within 5 mins.**

1. Go to [Vanus Playground](https://play.linkall.com) (an online K8s playground)

2. Click “Launch Terminal” to prepare an interactive K8s environment(Use your GitHub account to sign in).
