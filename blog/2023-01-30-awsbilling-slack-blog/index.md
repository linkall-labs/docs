# How to use Vanus to receive AWS Billing reports on Slack

As a developer or company, have you ever felt the need to have just another simpler way of monitoring your AWS Billings aside from Email notifications? Well, in this article, I will show you how it is easy to use Vanus and two connectors (AWS Billing Source & Slack Sink) to receive your AWS Billing reports on a Slack channel. This is made possible using Vanus Connect.

Vanus Connect is a set of producers and consumers to provide interoperability across services, systems, and platforms.

Vanus Connect has two kinds of connectors; Source connector and Sink Connector. The Source Connector obtains data from an underlying data producer (e.g. AWS Billing) and delivers the data to its target after the data has been transformed into CloudEvents. The Sink Connector receives the events with CloudEvent formats, processes the events, and sends them downstream to a consumer(e.g. Slack)



# AWS Billing Source
The AWS Billing Source Connector uses AWS Cost Explorer API to pull billing data from the previous day. The AWS Billing source requires a “target URL” to which it will send the CloudEvents. In this demo, we will be using Vanus Gateway to receive these CloudEvents. You will also need programmatic access credentials (access_key_id & secret_access_key) from your AWS account.

# Slack Sink
The Slack sink connector handles incoming CloudEvents in a way that extracts the data part of the original event and delivers these extracted data to Slack channels. To set up Slack sink correctly, you need to create a [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) and the app should have **chat:write** and **chat:write.public** permission

# Setting Up AWS Billing Source & Slack Sink using Vanus Connect
In this demo, we will be using the [Vanus Playground](https://play.linkall.com/); A cloud Kubernetes environment.
We will create the Slack sink connector first to receive incoming CloudEvents before setting up the AWS Billing Source connector.

To begin, we will install Vanus with the command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://vanus.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/releases/v0.6.0/vanus.yaml
```

Confirm that you have it installed:

```shell
kubectl get po -n vanus
```

You should see something like this:

```shell
vanus-controller-0               1/1     Running   0          96s
vanus-controller-1               1/1     Running   0          72s
vanus-controller-2               1/1     Running   0          69s
vanus-gateway-8677fc868f-rmjt9   1/1     Running   0          97s
vanus-store-0                    1/1     Running   0          96s
vanus-store-1                    1/1     Running   0          68s
vanus-store-2                    1/1     Running   0          68s
vanus-timer-5cd59c5bf-hmprp      1/1     Running   0          97s
vanus-timer-5cd59c5bf-pqkd5      1/1     Running   0          97s
vanus-trigger-7685d6cc69-8jgsl   1/1     Running   0          97s
```

Next, we will install vsctl, the command line tool for Vanus

```shell
curl -O https://dl.vanus.ai/vsctl/latest/linux-amd64/vsctl
chmod ug+x vsctl
mv vsctl /usr/local/bin
```

Vsctl needs a gateway URL to communicate with Vanus. Get the URL from the service called vanus-gateway.  To do this, we have to export the IP address as an Environmental Variable

```shell
export VANUS_GATEWAY=192.168.49.2:30001
```

# Setting Up Slack Sink
Now, let’s create a directory for our Slack Sink. To do this, use

```shell
mkdir slack
```

Our directory name is called slack, you can call it what you want. Next, we will move to that directory and create our config.yml file

```shell
cd slack
```
![img/img_2.png](img/img_2.png)


Inside the slack directory, create a file called config.yml
```shell
touch config.yml 
```
![img/img_3.png](img/img_3.png)

To set up Slack sink, we will need to set up our Slack App first and obtain the necessary credentials to receive our Billing report. To set up our Slack App, we will follow these steps:

Create a slack channel where you want to receive the billing
Create [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps/new). The App should have at least **chat:write** and **chat:write.public** permission
Create an App from scratch
Select the App name and Slack Workspace
Add permissions; **chat:write** and **chat:write.public**
Install OAuth tokens to your workspace
Copy the token which we will use in our **config.yml** file


Now, open the file with your text editor, for this, I will be using vim text editor
**vi config.yml** and paste the following code. Ensure you replace the default, app_name, default_channel, and token with yours.

```shell
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: sink-slack
  namespace: vanus
spec:
  selector:
    app: sink-slack
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      name: sink-slack
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: sink-slack
  namespace: vanus
data:
  config.yml: |-
    default: "input_default_name"
    slack:
      - app_name: "input_app_name"
        token: "input_your_token_here"
        default_channel: "#input_default_channel"
      

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sink-slack
  namespace: vanus
  labels:
    app: sink-slack
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sink-slack
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sink-slack
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: sink-slack
          image: public.ecr.aws/vanus/connector/sink-slack:latest
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "100m"
            limits:
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
          volumeMounts:
            - name: config
              mountPath: /vance/config
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: sink-slack
```

NOTE: The default and app name **MUST** be the same.

Now, run **kubectl apply -f config.yml** to set up the Slack Sink
![img/img_4.png](img/img_4.png)

Verify Slack sink is running
```shell
kubectl get pods -n vanus
```
![img/img_5.png](img/img_5.png)

Let us go back with the following command:

```shell 
cd ..
```
Before running our Amazon Billing Source, we will need to create an [Eventbus](https://www.vanus.ai/introduction/concepts). An Eventbus represents a group of pipelines that receive and dispatch events. To create the eventbus,
Here, for simplicity, I have named the eventbus **billing**

```shell 
vsctl eventbus create --name billing
```

# Setting Up AWS Billing Source
Create a config file for Amazon Billing Source, don't forget the update the access key and secret key obtained from your AWS console (IAM - Programmatic access)

```shell 
cat << EOF > config.yml
target: http://192.168.49.2:30002/gateway/billing
secret:
  access_key_id: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE # <- Your access key
  secret_access_key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY # <- Your secret key
EOF
```
Note: The target is the endpoint that will receive our Events in this case Vanus. 

Run Amazon billing with the following command: 

```shell
nohup docker run -it --rm --network=host \
  -v ${PWD}:/vanus-connect/config \
  --name source-aws-billing public.ecr.aws/vanus/connector/source-aws-billing > billing.log &
```

Just before we can receive the report on our slack channel, we need first to create a [subscription](https://www.vanus.ai/introduction/concepts) which will help us [transform](https://www.vanus.ai/introduction/concepts) the data coming from the AWS Billing report source to data that can be accepted by our Slack sink.

# Creating a Subscription
To create a subscription, paste this line of code

```shell
vsctl subscription create --name billing \
  --eventbus billing \
  --sink 'http://sink-slack:8080' \
  --transformer '{
      "define": {
		"source" : "$.source",
        "dataDate": "$.data.date",
		"dataService": "$.data.service",
		"dataAmt": "$.data.amount",
        "dataUnit": "$.data.unit"
      },
      "template": "{\"subject\": \"AWS Billing Report\",\"message\":\"Hello, Your AWS Billing Report on ${dataDate} for ${dataService} is ${dataAmt} ${dataUnit}\"}"
    }'
```
![img/img_7.png](img/img_7.png)

You should see some outputs like the one above. Now we have created a subscription for our Slack sink and also have transformed our data to be compatible with our Slack sink.
We can now send CloudEvents from our AWS Billing Source and we will receive the output on our Slack Sink.

To see the output of your billing.log use
**cat billing.log**

Finally, you can check your Slack App to see the Billing report

We successfully receive our AWS Billing reports on our Slack Channel. This will help you as a developer or Company to have just another simpler way of receiving AWS Billing reports.
