## How to Download a GitHub Repository？

If you want to download the whole repository instead of a specific file, you can download the repository as a zip archive from GitHub. Here's how:

### Step 1: Find the GitHub repository

- Go to the GitHub repository that you want to download.
- On the main repository page, click the green **Code** button.

### Step 2: Click "Download ZIP"

The repository will be downloaded as a zip archive, which you can extract to access the files.

**Note:** Keep in mind that downloading a repository as a zip archive will not include the Git history, so you won't be able to view the changes made to the files over time.  You'll need to clone the repository if you need to access the Git history.

**How to clone github repository** will be introduced in another blog.



## How to download a release from GitHub？

Repositories can put out releases that are packaged versions of the project. You can download a release from GitHub in the following ways:

### Step 1: Find the GitHub repository you need to download

- Go to the repository on GitHub where the release was published.
- Click on the "Releases" tab.

## **Automate GitHub with Vanus**

Vanus lets you connect GitHub to multiple applications so that you can automate more of your Git process. For example, as long as there is a new event in your repository, such as someone clicking a star or leaving a message on your issue or PR, you can receive a notification on Twitter or Slack in real-time, and the content of the notification can also be set by yourself.

The following tutorial can teach you how to implement how to receive GitHub notifications:
